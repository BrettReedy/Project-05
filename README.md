[1] Added multiple levels that scale in size and difficulty, the further the player progresses.
[1] Added music and sound effects to the important game objects and their interactions to make the game feel nicer to play
[1] Added a unique usage of the lighing mechanics by adding a flashlight for the player to destroy monsters with, as well as adding auras to every important game object, i.e. enemies, coins, portal to end the level, etc.

If I had more time to work on the project, I wanted to figure out how I could properly implement a minotaur enemy with charging mechanics similar to the last project I made, but I could not figure out how to implement raycasts with navmesh mechanics to properly implement the enemy, so I would try to take time to figure out how to make it work for future projects.  I would also like to figure out how to add unique models to 3D objects for future projects, but I could not remember how to properly implement those either.
